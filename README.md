# Module 1 Challenge

## Overview of Project
   
    My client Louise, wanted me to analyze the Kickstarter data to see the time table it took other plays to hit their fundraising goal compared to when they had their launch dates.    

### Purpose

    Louise is looking to see this analysis of other plays because she is very close to achieving her fundraising goal and has been able to do it in a short amount of time

## Analysis and Challenges

    Based on the data given and used over a 9 year period from 2009 to 2017 we can see that not everyone is able to achieve their fundraising goals.  It does though seem to have a pattern of better fundraising during the late spring and early summer months as well as (not surprisingly) the lower the goal the easier to achieve.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

    This review shows that fundraising tends to peak during the Spring and Summer months for the Theater community.  Not surprisingly we have our most successful fundraising during those months with our best months being May and June.  

    Failures stay steady though through the whole year and so do the canceled fundraisers.  With this view we can let Louise know that it is better to start her next venture during the Spring to have the best chance for it to be successful.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

    For this analysis the data was further broken down with fundraisers for plays, which is what Louise exclusively writes.  The data here shows that any goal under $5000 has a very good chance of succeeding.  Once the goal amount exceeds $10000 the chance of it being successful drops to a 50/50 chance. There are some good successful percentages in the $35000-$49000 range (67% success rate) but we have to keep in mind we don't have a lot of projects in that range.  In that range we only have a total of 9 projects compared to the projects we have under $10000, that number is 905 projects.  

    It really should come as no surprise that the lower the goal the better success rate is what we can surmise here.  It would be better for Louise to try to do a lower fundraising goal for success.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

    It was a challenge to understand and use the CountIFS formula but once I was able to understand how to understand what I was looking for I was able to create the formula that worked correctly.  It didn't help that at one point though I did make my goals much higher by making them 100000 to 149000 and etc. and it took me a bit to realize I had made that typo as to why the data wasn't coming properly.  



## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    we can conclude that the best months are May and June for fundraising to be successful.  Conversely we can see that the Winter months of November, December and January is the worst time to fundraise, at least for your theater goals.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

    If you are trying to raise your money under $5000, there is a good chance you'll hit your goal.  Anything past that becomes a 50/50 chance to succeed at best. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

    It's interesting to see that the summer months were the best time to raise money for the Theater Kickstarters.  It would be interesting to see if that kind of success happening in the other sectors that tried to raise money.  I think we could have added all the theater categories as well as I think that would give us an even bigger data set to work with and see if everything stays about the same. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

    I think bar graphs could be used for the outcomes by launch date, it would show the spring/summer months more clearly as being the best months for success.
